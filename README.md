## East Coast flooding

There was significant rainfall and flooding on the east coast of Australia
over an approximate 15 day period (23 Feb - 9 Mar) in 2022.

Weatherzone describes some of the records
[here](https://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/how-rare-was-this-rain-and-flooding-event/536508) and
[here](https://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/sydney-gradually-clearing-after-16-day-deluge/536560).

A quick look at the AGCD data (see `AGCD.ipynb`) shows that basically everywhere
east of the Great Dividing Range from the Sunshine Coast to the Vic/NSW border
received significant rain (>200mm) over that 15 day period.

The most appropriate analysis region for Rx15day might therefore be
the South-East Coast Topographic Drainage Division
and some of the River Regions within the North East Coast Division.
The BoM provides a summary and links to corresponding shapefiles
([summary](), [shapefiles]())
and the ABS also provides Drainage Division files.

The analysis of observational data is presented in the `AGCD_east-coast-flood-region.ipynb` notebook.
It was generated by running the `Makefile` as follows:
```
make rx15day-obs-analysis
```

There is also a jupyter notebook showing the UNSEEN analysis for each of the models (`analysis_{model-name}.ipynb`).
Each notebook was built using the `Makefile`. e.g.
```
make rx15day-forecast-analysis CONFIG=config/config_CanESM5.mk
```
The shapefile used in the Makefile was created by running `prepare_shapefile.ipynb`,
while the two conda environments referred to in the Makefile correspond to
`environment-unseen2.yml` and `environment-unseen-processing.yml`.

The figures that appear in the paper summarising the results from all the models
were generated using `ensemble_figures.ipynb`.
